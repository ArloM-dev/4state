# 4State

4State is a game based on a board game named 'l'attaque' or 'the atack'.
There are four main qualitys in the game, each with there own counterpart.
In the original game, these were:

- Tall | Short
- White | Black
- Square | Circle
- Flat | Hollowed

Each piece would consist of these four things or there counterpart,
creating 16 distinct pieces. For example, you could have a Tall, Black,
Square, Hollowed piece or a Short, Black, Circle, Flat piece. Basic maths shows
us that there are two possibilitys for each quality, which is 2x2x2x2 or 2^4,
which is 16 diferent pieces.
