# 4State

4State is a two player game based on a board game named 'l'attaque' or 'the atack'.
4State is a board game based on a game I bought while in France,
originaly named 'l'attaque' or 'the atack' in english.
It's almost like a complicated version of tic-tac-toe,
with a 4 by 4 grid and pieces that have multiple qualities or 'states' as I have called them.
Although it is not currently finished, it should be available soon,
and I update the Unity project files as I go along.

## Description

### Game Pieces

There are four main qualitys in the game, each with there own counterpart.
In the original game, these were:

- Tall | Short
- White | Black
- Square | Circle
- Flat | Hollowed

Each piece would consist of these four qualitys or there counterpart,
creating 16 distinct pieces. For example, you could have a Tall, Black,
Square, Hollowed piece or a Short, Black, Circle, Flat piece. Basic maths shows
us that there are two possibilitys for each quality, which is 2x2x2x2 or 2^4,
which is 16 diferent pieces.

### How to play

The game is very simple, and each step is repeated untill the game is won.
Name the first player A and the second B.
The steps are as follows:

- Player B selects an available piece for player A.
- player A then places this on an empty square on the 4 by 4 grid.

The aim of the game is to get four in a row of of the same quality.
